        I am a proactive second-year computer science student at the University of Sydney, where my passion for cloud development and cyber-security has been nurtured and reinforced. I have developed my own website using cutting-edge technologies like React, TailwindCSS, Node.js, and Three.js, which demonstrates my capabilities in creating visually engaging, responsive web designs and integrating 3D graphics seamlessly. <br/> <br/> As a fast learner, I can rapidly adapt to new tools and methodologies, allowing me to work closely with clients to develop efficient, scalable, and user-centric solutions. Presently, I am focused on spinning up cloud instances and designing visually stunning, responsive websites that cater to various audiences while providing immersive 3D experiences. My primary expertise lies in frontend technologies, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I am proficient in backend development using Java and Node.js.
